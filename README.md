## Introduction

This repository consists of a few main subdirectories:

| Directory              | Purpose                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scripts/`             | primary scripts (added into _PATH_)                                                   |
| `cron/`                | scripts executed by cron (not added to _PATH_)                                        |
| `deamons/`             | scripts executed automatically on system start and kept running (not added to _PATH_) |
| `system-dependencies/` | helpers to install system-wide dependencies                                           |
